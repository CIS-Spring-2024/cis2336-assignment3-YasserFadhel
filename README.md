Order Form

Description:
The "Order Form" is a web page designed to facilitate the selection, customization, and submission of food orders. Built with JavaScript, it dynamically generates menu items, allowing users to specify quantities and submit orders seamlessly.

Please note that this is the "Order Now" page on the CoogEats website and is different from the menu page. It shares a similar layout and stylization to the menu page to enure a more cohesive user experience.


Features:

Dynamic Menu Creation: Utilizes JavaScript to dynamically create menu items, providing users with a visually appealing and interactive interface.

Item Selection and Quantity Specification: Enables users to select items from the menu and specify quantities based on their preferences.

Dynamic Shopping Cart: Implements a dynamic shopping cart system that updates in real-time as users add or remove items, providing a clear overview of the selected items and their quantities.

Validation Checks: Includes validation checks to ensure that all selected quantities are within the acceptable range and not negative. Additionally, it removes an item from the cart if its quantity is set to 0.

Feedback on Quantity Limit: Utilizes the item ID to give feedback to users when they attempt to exceed the maximum quantity limit for a particular item.

Visual Distinction for Hovered Items: Utilizes JavaScript to create a visual distinction for items that are being hovered over, enhancing the user experience and providing clear feedback on item selection.
